# BynomialDistribuTool
## Info:
The following code, when compiled, will give you access to the BinomialDistribuTool, that is capable of parsing text files with test results to get the sucess chance of a binomial event. Also, it calculates odds for some n of k (n successes considering k total events) with the current success chance, and some interval of n sucesses considering k total events. This project was done because I'm currently taking statistics and wanted a quick tool to check if my solutions were correct.
